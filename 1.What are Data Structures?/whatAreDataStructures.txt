________________________________ What Are Data Structures? _________________________________________

Data Structures are special ways to store, organize, and manage data in a computer so that we can use the data easily and efficiently.

-> When we need to add, remove, search, or sort data, data structures help us to do that quickly.



_________________________________ Examples of Common Data Structures ________________________________

1. Array
 -> A list where data is stored in order.
 -> Example: [10, 20, 30, 40]

2. Linked list
 -> Data is stored in nodes where each node points to the next one.
 -> like a chain

3. Stack
 -> Follow Last in, First out (LIFO).
 -> Like a stack of plates: the last plate you put on the first you take off.

4. Queue
 -> Follow First in, First out (FIFO)
 -> Like a waiting line: the first person in the line is served first.

5. Tree
 -> Data is stored like branches of a Tree
 -> Example: Family Tree

6. Graph
 -> Data is stored as connections between nodes.
 -> Example: Social networks like facebook.

7. Hash table (Dictionary)
 -> Data is stored using a key to quickly find values.
 -> Exampl: Phonebook (Name:Phone Number)




 🚀 Example in Real Life:

    📱 Contact list on your phone → Array or Dictionary

    🗂️ Stack of files → Stack

    🎫 Queue at a ticket counter → Queue

    👨‍👩‍👧 Family tree → Tree

    🌐 Social networks → Graph
